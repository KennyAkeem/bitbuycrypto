# Aurora Investments — Next.js Demo

This is a demo Next.js starter for a Bitcoin investment prototype.

What it includes
- Landing page with company blurb, features, and reviews
- Client-side login/register using localStorage (demo-only)
- Profile page with portfolio, transaction history, and a simulated Buy BTC flow
- Live BTC price fetched from CoinGecko (client-side) with fallback

Run locally
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000

Important notes
- This project is strictly a front-end demo. Do NOT use it to store real credentials or funds.
- To convert to production: add a proper backend, secure auth, and integrate custody/onramp providers.
